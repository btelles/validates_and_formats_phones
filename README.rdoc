= ValidatesAndFormatsPhones

Allows you to easily format and validate phone numbers in your desired format 
(sensible defaults provided).

Just add 'validates_and_formats_phones' to your ActiveRecord model.

The default format is a 10-digit US phone number on the column 'phone'.
But you can change all that...just read on.

== Installation

1. Install it as a gem:

      sudo gem install validates_and_formats_phones

2. Then add it to your <tt>environment.rb</tt> file

      config.gem 'validates_and_formats_phones'

3. Add the method <tt>validates_and_formats_phones</tt> to your model


== Example


Adding the validates_and_formats_phones method by itself gives you
validation and formatting for the field :phone like so:


  class Person
    validates_and_formats_phones
  end

  > person = Person.new(:phone => '123 456 7890')
  > person.save 
  > person.phone 
  > => '(123) 456-7890'
  >
  > person.phone = '123'
  > person.save
  > => false

You can pass your own fields like so:

  class Person
    validates_and_formats_phones :fax, :mobile
  end


Or your own formats by using a # symbol for number substitutions:

  class Person
    validates_and_formats_phones '####-####', '### ###-####'
  end

Note that the validation is simplistic. It counts the number of digits in the given field.
If the number of digits in the given field matches one of the formats, then the validation
passes and the format that has the same number of '#' symbols will be used to format
the phone number.

You can also format and specify fields, like so:

  class Person
    validates_and_formats_phones :fax, mobile, '####-####'
  end
